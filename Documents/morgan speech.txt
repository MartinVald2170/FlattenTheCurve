We decided to go with a SaaS (Software as a Service) model. We will offer two different subscriptions types: Personal and Enterprise. A personal account is an individual user, though you will able to add friends and track each other's progress. As a reward for reaching goals, we will partner with local businesses and arrange for discounts on good or cheap/free subscriptions.

The enterprise model is designed for businesses. On top of the personal rewards, enterprise admins can offer additional rewards to the most productive users such as gift cards, paid memberships etc. Progress can potentially be tracked on a leaderboard too.
