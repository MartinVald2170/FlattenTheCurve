#Will probably get everyone to do a slide each

1st person 
Our group decided to tackle the issue of people having less motivation to be productive during day to day life
in these trying times due to CORVID-19. We don't want people to feel like they are wasting away while we wait
for the lockdowns to be over. This is where our app comes in 

*slide appears on screen with a name and possible facecam in a corner* 
We are introducing (name of app) which is a goal setting app with rewards and punishments for the user so they 
feel motivated aswell as feeling like they have been challenged to complete daily tasks they set for themselves

These tasks can be centered around different types of people such as content creators who want to feel motivated to
keep working on their projects to people who just want to get chores done.

On behalf of the Backrow group I’d like to thank the ACS for organising this hackathon, 
all the sponsors and judges for making this possible. 
This is our first hackathon but certainly won’t be our last! 

And a massive shout out to our instructors, Bruce McLure and Mike Dane for teaching us these skills
